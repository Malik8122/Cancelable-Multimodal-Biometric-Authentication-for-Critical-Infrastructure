"""Face enrollment vocabulary: the five guided captures and the per-capture verdicts.

Face enrollment is a ONE-TIME, five-capture protocol - all five mostly-frontal (see
GuidedFaceCapture.tsx's guidance text): neutral, natural expression, slight natural left
variation, slight natural right variation, and a slight natural distance/expression variation.
Deliberately NOT extreme head turns (an earlier version of this protocol asked for front/left/
right/up/down poses with real head rotation - reverted because `preprocessing/face.py`'s MTCNN
step has no landmark-based rotation correction, so a rotated capture measurably hurts the
resulting centroid's similarity to a normal, frontal live capture - see the alignment
investigation). Per capture: MTCNN detection, alignment, quality gating (see
`preprocessing/face.py` and `embeddings/pipelines.py::_evaluate_face_quality` for the exact
checks and how each threshold was measured), one 512-d embedding for captures that pass. The
valid embeddings are averaged into a centroid, the temporary embeddings are discarded immediately,
and the T1-T4 template sets are generated from the centroid alone.
