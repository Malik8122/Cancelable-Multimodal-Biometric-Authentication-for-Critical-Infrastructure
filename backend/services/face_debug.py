"""TEMPORARY, LOCAL-DEVELOPMENT-ONLY face diagnostics (DEBUG_SCORES=true).

Exists to gather real, one-time scalar measurements from a live browser enrollment +
authentication, to help decide whether insufficient geometric face alignment (MTCNN crops the
detected bounding box but performs no landmark-based rotation/affine alignment - see the
alignment investigation) is why genuine face Hamming similarity has measured ~0.70-0.74 against
this project's 0.80 threshold. Delete this module and its two call sites in
`backend/services/base_service.py` once that investigation is resolved - this is not a permanent
feature.

Hard rules, enforced by construction, not by convention:
- Every value computed and logged here is a single Python float (a cosine similarity, or a mean/
  min/max/std of several) - never a vector, never an array, never anything that could be used to
  reconstruct an embedding, image, or template.
- Nothing here is persisted: no database write, no file write, no return value added to any API
  response - `logging.Logger.info` only, exactly like this project's existing `ENROLL-DEBUG` /
  `AUTH-DEBUG` lines (`backend/services/base_service.py`).
- Callers gate every call on `Settings.debug_scores` - this module has no gate of its own, so it
  never accidentally runs when a caller forgets to check, but it also never runs unless a caller
  explicitly asked (see `ModalityService.enroll_poses` / `.authenticate_embedding`).
- The real authentication decision is computed entirely before these functions are ever called
  (`template_protection.matcher.compare`/`accept`, unchanged) - nothing here can influence it;
  these functions return `None` and are called purely for their logging side effect.
