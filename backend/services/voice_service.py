"""Voice biometric service: wraps `embeddings.pipelines.VoicePipeline`.

`ModalityService` (base_service.py, shared by every modality) calls
`self.pipeline.embed(raw_image)` with exactly one positional argument - true
for Face/Iris/Fingerprint, whose pipelines take just an image array. Voice's
pipeline needs a second argument (`sample_rate`) because a raw waveform
alone doesn't say what rate it was captured at - see
`embeddings/pipelines.py::VoicePipeline`'s own docstring for why its
`embed()` is overridden with that extra parameter.

Rather than changing `ModalityService` (shared by all four modalities, and
explicitly out of scope to redesign), `_VoicePipelineAdapter` below satisfies
the *same* single-argument `embed(raw_input)` contract by accepting
`raw_input` as a `(waveform, sample_rate)` tuple instead of a bare array -
exactly what `backend/utils.py::decode_audio` already returns. This is a
voice-specific adapter, invisible to `ModalityService` and to every other
modality's code path.
