"""Per-modality authentication threshold, loaded from real calibration data.

Replaces the old behavior of comparing every modality's protected-template
Hamming score against one hardcoded `Settings.match_threshold=0.9` - see
`evaluation/threshold_calibration.py` for how `evaluation/results/<modality>_threshold.json`
is produced from real genuine/impostor protected-template scores.

Fails gracefully, per the spec: a modality with no calibration file yet
(e.g. iris, or before the calibration script has been run for a given
checkpoint) falls back to `Settings.match_threshold`, logging a clear
warning rather than raising - authentication must keep working even for an
uncalibrated modality.
