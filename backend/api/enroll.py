"""POST /enroll: preprocess -> embed -> one protected template per template set -> store.

One enrollment yields a template in each of `TEMPLATE_POOL_SIZE` (default 4) template SETS (set 1 ACTIVE, the rest
STANDBY). Enroll each modality in turn and every set ends up holding all of them. Never returns template bytes.

Face is a ONE-TIME five-pose enrollment: `pose_front`, `pose_left`, `pose_right`, `pose_up`, `pose_down`. Each pose is
detected (MTCNN), aligned and embedded; only blurry or faceless poses are rejected. The valid embeddings are averaged into
a centroid, the temporary embeddings are discarded, and T1-T4 are generated from the centroid alone. (A single `image`
still enrolls a face from one capture.) `POST /enroll/face/check-pose` gives the UI an immediate verdict per pose.

Declared as a plain `def` route: the service call runs CPU-bound OpenCV and
PyTorch inference, which FastAPI runs in a threadpool automatically.
