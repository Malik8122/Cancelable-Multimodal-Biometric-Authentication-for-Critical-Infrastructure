"""GET /metrics/{modality}: real, already-computed evaluation numbers - never invented here.

Reads `evaluation/results/<modality>_metrics.csv`, the same artifact
`evaluation/fingerprint_metrics.py`/`evaluation/voice_metrics.py` write from
real Kaggle GPU runs. If a modality's file doesn't exist (or a field within
it was never computed), that's returned as missing/absent rather than
fabricated - `available: false` for a whole modality, or a field simply not
present in `metrics` otherwise. This module does zero inference and touches
no model checkpoints; it just formats a CSV as JSON.
