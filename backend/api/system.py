"""GET /system/health: a real (not hardcoded) snapshot of backend readiness.

Distinct from the existing bare `GET /health` (which only proves the process
is up) - this checks the database and calibration state are real, and
reports each modality's model status. Every field is computed at request
time, not a static dict.

**Must never instantiate a model itself.** `get_face_service`/
`get_fingerprint_service`/`get_voice_service` are `@lru_cache`d, zero-argument
functions - the first real call to any of them builds the full pipeline and
loads its checkpoint (100+ MB each for face/fingerprint), which is exactly
the memory a 512 MB deployment can't spare on every health check. This
endpoint is polled automatically every 15s by the frontend
(frontend/src/hooks/useAuthSession.ts), so calling all three getters here
unconditionally previously forced all three checkpoints to load together on
the very first poll. `_model_status` below checks `getter.cache_info().currsize`
(a plain counter on the decorator, not a call) to see whether a *previous*
real request already paid that cost - reusing that already-loaded result is
free - and otherwise only stats the configured checkpoint path (also cheap)
rather than building the pipeline.
