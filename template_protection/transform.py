"""The BioHashing-style cancelable transform's math, stage by stage.

Every function here is a pure numpy computation: no key derivation (that's
`hkdf_keys.py`), no orchestration (that's `biohash.py`), no I/O. Each stage
takes an already-derived seed (raw bytes) and is deterministic given that
seed, which is the property the whole cancelable-template scheme depends on:
the same seed always reproduces the same projection matrix / permutation /
thresholds, on any machine or process, because `numpy.random.default_rng`
(PCG64) is a fixed, portable algorithm that does not consult system entropy.

Pipeline (see `biohash.py::generate_template` for the orchestration):

    embedding (unit vector, dim D)
        -> build_orthonormal_projection(seed, bits, D)   -> matrix (bits, D)
        -> project(embedding, matrix)                    -> real vector (bits,)
        -> quantize(projected, seed)                      -> bit vector (bits,)
        -> apply_permutation(bits, seed)                  -> bit vector (bits,)  [final template]

    different bits) with small random jitter drawn from
    `Normal(0, 0.5 * std(projected))` per position, seeded by
    `threshold_seed`.

    The jitter's scale is tied to `projected`'s own standard deviation rather
    than a fixed constant, because `project`'s output magnitude depends on
    `embedding_dim` and `output_bits` (each component is a dot product of two
    unit vectors, so its typical size shrinks as ~1/sqrt(embedding_dim)) - a
    fixed-scale threshold (e.g. Uniform(-1, 1)) would dwarf that signal in
    high dimensions and make quantization ignore the embedding almost
    entirely, which would silently break both recognition (same embedding
    should reproduce its template) and discrimination (different embeddings
    should differ). Scaling relative to the data keeps the threshold's
    influence calibrated regardless of dimensionality, while still being
