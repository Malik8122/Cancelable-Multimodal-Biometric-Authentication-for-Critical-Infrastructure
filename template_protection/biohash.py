"""BioHashing-inspired cancelable template generation.

Orchestrates `transform.py`'s math stages into the single call the rest of
the system uses:

    template = generate_template(embedding, key)

Full pipeline, matching docs/TEMPLATE_PROTECTION.md:

1. **Normalize** the embedding to unit L2 norm (defensively re-applied; see
   `utils.l2_normalize`).
2. **Project**: build a `key.projection_seed`-derived orthonormal projection
   matrix (`transform.build_orthonormal_projection`) and apply it
   (`transform.project`), mapping the embedding into `output_bits` real
   values bounded in [-1, 1].
3. **Quantize**: binarize each projected value against a
   `key.threshold_seed`-derived per-position random threshold
   (`transform.quantize`).
4. **Permute**: reorder the resulting bits with a `key.permutation_seed`-derived
   permutation (`transform.apply_permutation`).

The result is a fixed-length `np.uint8` array of 0s/1s - the "protected
template" that `backend/` persists in place of the raw embedding. Producing
the *same* template again requires the *same* `KeyMaterial` (i.e. the same
master secret + application/user/modality/key_version) and the *same*
embedding (i.e. successfully re-authenticating the same biometric); anything
else yields a statistically unrelated bit string.

**Non-invertibility, stated honestly:** this pipeline is a many-to-one,
information-lossy map (a `dim`-dimensional real vector collapses to
`output_bits` bits), which makes reconstructing the original embedding from
the template *alone* infeasible. This is **not** a cryptographic one-way
function with a computational-hardness proof - it is a data-transformation
argument. If an attacker also recovers the key material (and hence the exact
projection matrix, thresholds, and permutation), partial reconstruction of
the embedding becomes a studied attack in the BioHashing literature. See
docs/TEMPLATE_PROTECTION.md for the full assumptions/limitations discussion;
nothing in this codebase claims stronger security than that.
