"""Voice embedding model: SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN speaker embedding.

Produces a 192-dimensional embedding from an 80-bin log-mel filterbank (see
preprocessing/voice.py). `models/voice/saved/` holds any fine-tuned
checkpoint produced by notebooks/04_voice_training.ipynb or
kaggle_kernels/voice_training/.

**Interface note (see docs/VOICE_MODEL.md's "Integration" section for the
full rationale):** `VoiceEmbedder.extract_embedding` has the exact same
signature as every other modality - `extract_embedding(image: np.ndarray)`
where `image` is a preprocessed `(H, W, 3)` array - *not*
`extract_embedding(audio_path)` as an early draft of the spec suggested.
`image` here is really an (n_mels, n_frames) log-mel spectrogram replicated
to 3 identical channels (by `embeddings/pipelines.py::VoicePipeline`, the
same "2D -> pseudo-RGB" trick `preprocessing/iris.py` already relies on) so
that `BaseEmbedder`'s shared, deliberately narrow contract - the thing that
lets `embeddings/pipelines.py` and later fusion/backend code treat all four
modalities uniformly - never needs a voice-specific carve-out. The
path-based convenience functions the spec actually wants
(`load_model`/`extract_embedding`/`compare_embeddings`) are the free
functions below, built on top of that contract rather than replacing it.
