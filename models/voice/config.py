"""All Voice module hyperparameters in one place.

Every audio-pipeline and training knob is a field here rather than scattered
constants, per the spec's "everything configurable inside config.py" —
unlike Face/Iris/Fingerprint (which hardcode a handful of module-level
constants directly in inference.py), Voice has enough independently-tunable
parameters (sample rate, clip length, mel bins, FFT/hop, VAD backend, plus a
full training recipe) that a single config object is worth the extra
structure. Defaults match docs/VOICE_MODEL.md's hyperparameter table.
