"""Voice embedding backbone: SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN.

Mirrors models/fingerprint/inference.py::FingerprintEmbeddingNet's
`__new__`-based lazy-import trick: `speechbrain`/`torch.nn` are only
imported the first time a real (non-mock-mode) VoiceEmbedder is actually
constructed, so importing this module - or models/voice/inference.py, or
models/voice/config.py etc. - never requires `speechbrain` to be installed.
See docs/VOICE_MODEL.md's "Zero hard dependencies for preprocessing/testing"
note for why that matters on a dev machine without these optional deps.

Takes precomputed log-mel features directly (shape (batch, time, n_mels)),
not raw waveform - `speechbrain.lobes.models.ECAPA_TDNN.ECAPA_TDNN` supports
this out of the box, which is what lets preprocessing/voice.py (not
SpeechBrain's own built-in feature extractor) own log-mel extraction, the
same way preprocessing/face.py, iris.py, and fingerprint.py each own their
modality's classical preprocessing rather than delegating it into the model.
