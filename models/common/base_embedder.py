"""Common interface every modality's embedding model must implement.

Keeping this interface identical across face / iris / fingerprint is what lets
the rest of the system (template protection in Phase 2, fusion in Phase 3)
treat all three modalities uniformly:

    embedding = embedder.extract_embedding(image)

`image` is always an RGB `numpy.ndarray` of shape (H, W, 3), dtype uint8 —
callers are responsible for running the modality-specific preprocessing
(see `preprocessing/`) before calling this.
