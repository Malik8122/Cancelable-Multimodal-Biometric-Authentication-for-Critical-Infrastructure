"""Fusion decision policies.

The audit finding this fixes: `fuse_scores`'s plain weighted average let one
strong modality compensate for another that individually failed its own
threshold - e.g. Face=1.0 (pass) + Fingerprint=0.82 (individually a fail at
threshold=0.9) averaged to 0.91, which cleared the fusion threshold even
though Fingerprint's own result said "no match". `fusion/policy.py` is where
that decision actually gets made now; this module only defines the available
policies and their tunable parameters.
