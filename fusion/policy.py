    populates these from `provided`), so every policy below automatically
    inherits the "omitted modalities never count" rule from its caller

      True. The new default - fixes the audit finding that a strong match
      could compensate for another modality's individual failure.
    - `AT_LEAST_TWO`: only valid when exactly three modalities were
      submitted; at least two of the three must individually pass.
    - `WEIGHTED`: the original weighted-average behavior, but any submitted
      modality scoring below `weighted_floor` now vetoes authentication
      outright, regardless of the average.
