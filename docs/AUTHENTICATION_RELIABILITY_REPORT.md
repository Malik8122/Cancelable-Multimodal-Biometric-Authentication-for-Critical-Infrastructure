# Authentication Reliability Report

**Sprint:** Phase 2.7 — Authentication Reliability Sprint (root-cause pass)
**Scope:** Backend only (`preprocessing/`, `template_protection/`, `fusion/`, `backend/`, `evaluation/`). No UI, API contract, or database schema changes. **No threshold was changed. `ALL_REQUIRED` remains the default fusion policy.**

## Debug: "genuine user denied after the multi-template migration" (Phase 3B.1)

**Reported:** a user enrolled face + fingerprint + voice and was `ACCESS_DENIED` when authenticating right after.

**Investigation (real face / fingerprint / voice models, real TTS speech, real HTTP layer, no stubs):**

- Enrollment integrity: 4 sets x 3 modalities, exactly one ACTIVE row per modality, all in set 1; `template_version` is the
  BioHash format version (1), the pool position is `template_set_version`; key version == set version. Correct.
- Authentication reads only the ACTIVE set-1 rows (a spy on `crud.get_active_template` saw nothing else); all three
  modality results enter fusion; identical files -> similarity 1.0000 for each -> `ACCESS_GRANTED`.
- **No regression in matching:** `git diff` of `preprocessing/`, `embeddings/`, `template_protection/` (HKDF, BioHash),
  `fusion/` and `backend/threshold_loader.py` against the pre-migration commit is empty (only the uncommitted face
  checkpoint loader differs). The same samples score *identically to four decimals* under (A) the pre-migration code,
  (B) the new code on that old database after migration, and (C) the new code with a fresh enrollment.
- Genuine recaptures pass with realistic variation (face 0.906-1.0, fingerprint 0.97-0.99, voice 0.94-1.0). Browser sample
  rates (16 / 44.1 / 48 kHz) are handled consistently. What flips a genuine voice is additive microphone noise (0.75-0.80 at
  sigma=0.01) - a property of the voice pipeline against the *uncalibrated 0.90* threshold (no `*_threshold.json` exists),
  unchanged by the migration and consistent with the earlier real-user incident (0.898 / 0.719).

**Real defect found and fixed:** the voice enrollment consistency check (enroll take 1, then verify take 2) left an ACTIVE
voice template when the check failed. Fix: `POST /enroll` accepts `confirm_image`; `ModalityService.enroll` compares the two
samples first and raises `EnrollmentInconsistent` before writing anything (`backend/services/base_service.py`,
`backend/api/enroll.py`). Tests: `tests/test_genuine_auth_regression.py`. With `DEBUG_SCORES=true` the backend now logs
`AUTH-DEBUG` (per modality) and `FUSION-DEBUG` (fusion stage) lines - metadata only, never embeddings or templates.

## Genuine face and voice users denied at the 0.90 threshold (V3.2)

**Reported:** the same person, enrolled and then authenticating with face + voice, got ACCESS_DENIED with "Verified Factors: None".

**Evidence** (audit log of the real attempts, user `OPERATOR-UWKAMM`): fingerprint 1.000 (the identical file), face 0.754 / 0.766 / 0.820,
voice 0.797 / 0.848 / 0.879 - all genuine, all below the 0.90 fallback (no `*_threshold.json` existed). No code defect was found: the matching
path, the migration and the enrollment flows were checked earlier and unchanged.

**Root cause:** the threshold is applied to the 256-bit *protected-template* Hamming similarity, which saturates far below the embedding
cosine. Measured with the project's BioHash (25 random pairs per row, same key):

| enrolled-to-live embedding cosine | face (512-d) | voice (192-d) |
|---|---|---|
| 0.98 | 0.941 | 0.939 |
| 0.95 | 0.909 | 0.909 |
| 0.90 | 0.879 | 0.870 |
| 0.80 | 0.814 | 0.816 |
| 0.75 | 0.797 | 0.800 |
| 0.60 | 0.741 | 0.734 |
| 0.50 | 0.723 | 0.704 |
| 0.30 | 0.639 | 0.638 |
| 0.00 | 0.547 | 0.558 |

So 0.90 demands an embedding cosine of about **0.95** between the enrolled and the live capture. Real webcam / microphone captures of the same
person typically give 0.7-0.9, i.e. template similarity 0.78-0.88 - exactly the observed scores. (A different speaker measured 0.51-0.56 cosine =
0.72-0.74 template similarity.)

**Change (operator decision):** `evaluation/results/face_threshold.json` and `voice_threshold.json` set the threshold to **0.80**; fingerprint and iris
keep the 0.90 fallback. These files are marked `"source": "operator-specified"` with no FAR/FRR/EER - the number was chosen, not measured, and
`/metrics/{modality}` reports only the threshold for them. Delete a file to restore 0.90; replace it with `scripts/calibrate_protected_thresholds.py`
output once real multi-person data exists.

**What 0.80 does and does not fix:** of the three logged attempts (ALL_REQUIRED face + voice) only the first (face 0.820, voice 0.848) would now pass; the
second fails on face 0.766 and the third on face 0.754 / voice 0.797. A face threshold near 0.72-0.75 would be needed to accept all three, at the cost of a
smaller margin over impostors (different people give template similarity <= ~0.66 for face, ~0.74 for the one different speaker tested). The margin between
0.80 and the impostor range is real but has only been measured on a handful of samples.

### Follow-up: face stays at 0.80 (operator decision)

With face at 0.80 the same user was still mostly denied: fifteen logged genuine face attempts scored 0.738-0.859 (mean 0.784; only 5 of 15 reached 0.80).
Face was briefly set to 0.72 and then **reset to 0.80** at the operator's instruction: a lower face threshold would also let AI-generated / synthetic face images
through as real. Face therefore remains 0.80 (voice 0.80, fingerprint / iris 0.90 fallback).

Consequence to be aware of: at 0.80 most of this user's genuine face captures still fall below the threshold. The threshold is not the right lever for the
underlying problem, and it is also not a defence against synthetic images - resisting AI-generated or replayed faces needs a liveness / presentation-attack check,
which this system does not have. Why the real face scores ~0.77 rather than ~0.9 is not established; one suspect is the five-pose centroid, but a test with warped
copies of one portrait (cosine to the frontal image 0.89-0.97) neither confirms nor rules that out. Answering it needs real captures - e.g. one person enrolled once
with the frontal image only and once with the five poses, then compared on fresh frontal captures.

## Voice enrollment consistency check: from strict to graded (V3.1)

The first version compared the two enrollment recordings through BioHash with the 0.90 authentication threshold. That measures a
fragile 256-bit hash, not speaker identity, and rejected genuine users after natural variation (e.g. moderate microphone noise).
It now uses the **cosine similarity of the two ECAPA-TDNN embeddings** in four bands - Excellent >= 0.85, Good 0.75-0.84, Fair 0.60-0.74
(warn, user decides), Poor < 0.60 (reject) - so only clearly mismatched recordings are rejected. Real-model measurements: same speaker
0.98-0.99, with mic noise 0.66-0.73, different speaker 0.51-0.56. Authentication thresholds, fusion, template generation and the T1-T4 pool
are unchanged. Note the genuine *authentication* sensitivity to noise (BioHash Hamming vs the 0.90 threshold) described below is a
separate matter and was not touched.

## 128 vs 256-bit BioHash migration

Following the statistical-separability investigation below, `Settings.template_bits` (`backend/config.py`) was raised from 128 to **256** for all new enrollments/revocations. `ModalityService.authenticate` already regenerated the candidate template at the *stored* template's own `output_bits` (not this setting), so this change cannot cause an old 128-bit template to be silently compared at the wrong bit length — no architectural change was needed for that safety property, it already existed. `template_version` (`TEMPLATE_FORMAT_VERSION`) was deliberately **not** bumped: the transform algorithm itself is unchanged, only its bit-length parameter, and `output_bits` is already its own per-row column that fully distinguishes old (128) from new (256) templates.

**Why:** a real, same-underlying-samples measurement (20 synthetic identities × 5 samples each, real face/voice checkpoints, same-key BioHash pairing) showed 128-bit BioHash measurably discards discriminative information versus the raw embedding for both modalities, and versus 256-bit:

| | Raw AUC | 128-bit AUC | 128-bit EER | 256-bit AUC | 256-bit EER |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Face | 0.935 | 0.861 | 20.7% | 0.909 | 19.1% |
| Voice | 0.997 | 0.959 | 8.6% | 0.986 | 5.6% |

256 bits improved both modalities using the *same* embeddings as the 128-bit measurement (only `output_bits` varied) — not a re-run with new, possibly-friendlier samples. Voice's embedding is 192-dim (< 256), so its 256-bit projection uses a second, non-orthogonal-to-the-first block (`template_protection/transform.py::build_orthonormal_projection`'s documented multi-block fallback) — an explicit tradeoff that did not, in this measurement, cost voice any separability; face's 512-dim embedding stays within one fully-orthonormal block at 256 bits.

**Not done, deliberately:** `match_threshold` (0.9) was left unchanged — the new genuine/impostor distributions are reported so a threshold decision can be made deliberately later, not inferred silently from this migration. No model was retrained. VAD, denoising, and lighting normalization were left untouched, per explicit scope.

## Incident: real user report — Face 0.898 / Voice 0.719, both denied

**Report:** UI showed `Face: 0.898 / 0.900 / No Match`, `Voice: 0.719 / 0.900 / No Match`, `Fusion: Denied`, for a user stating they were the same person enrolled. Template Version=v1, Key Version=v3.

**Investigation performed** (preprocessing determinism, embedding/model identity, key derivation, template storage/retrieval, fusion logic, threshold calibration — in that order) against the **real running backend and its real database** (`manual_test.db`, not the empty `biometric.db` at the repo root — confirmed via `GET /system/health`):

1. **Template retrieval (real data, not a hypothetical)**: the database contains user `DEMO-YWKQMU7B` with face and voice templates at exactly `template_version=1, key_version=3` — matching the report precisely. `crud.get_active_template()`, called directly against this real row, correctly returns the `key_version=3` (latest, active) template for both modalities, not an older one. Template storage/versioning is correct.
2. **Preprocessing/model identity**: `ModalityService.enroll()` and `.authenticate()` both call the identical `self.pipeline.embed(raw_image)` (`backend/services/base_service.py`) — the same object, same method, same trained checkpoint (confirmed `mock_mode=False` for face/fingerprint/voice). There is no code path for these to diverge.
3. **The decisive evidence — bit-level analysis**: Hamming similarity on a 128-bit template can only be an exact multiple of 1/128. "0.898" is a *rounded display* value; the true score was **115/128 (0.8984375) — exactly one bit-flip short** of the 116/128 (0.90625) needed to clear 0.9. Voice's "0.719" was **92/128 (0.71875) — 36 bits differing**.

   This distinguishes a real bug from threshold calibration decisively: the two real bugs already found and fixed in this codebase (`_trim_silence`'s frame-overlap duplication, and mel-domain padding contamination — both in `preprocessing/voice.py`) each collapsed genuine similarity to **near-chance or outright negative** cosine similarity when triggered. A clean one-bit miss on a real, correctly-processed capture is not that signature - it's the expected, inherent quantization sensitivity of BioHash landing just barely on the wrong side of an **uncalibrated** threshold, confirmed with real user data rather than a synthetic proxy for the first time.
4. **Fusion logic**: re-confirmed unchanged - `ALL_REQUIRED` (`fusion/config.py::DEFAULT_FUSION_POLICY`) requires every submitted modality to individually pass; it does not apply `fusion_threshold` as a decision gate under this policy (`fusion/policy.py::evaluate_fusion_policy` - `fusion_threshold` only matters for `WEIGHTED`). Face failing by one bit and voice failing by a wider margin were each individually and correctly evaluated; fusion correctly denied because not every modality passed - not a fusion bug.
5. **Full pytest suite (308 tests) re-run clean**, and `scripts/debug_authentication_pipeline.py` re-run fresh confirms no regression from any commit since the last pass (genuine three-modality attempt still authenticates under realistic synthetic variation).

**Root cause: confirmed to be the same, already-diagnosed uncalibrated-threshold gap** (`Settings.match_threshold=0.9`, with no `evaluation/results/{face,voice}_threshold.json` calibration file present) - not a preprocessing, model, template-retrieval, or fusion bug. This incident is the first confirmation of that diagnosis against a **real user's real templates** rather than only synthetic test data, and shows the gap affects face too (previously only confirmed for voice), even though face's margin here was much narrower (1 bit) than voice's (36 bits).

**Fix implemented:** none to production code - none was warranted; every mechanical component was verified correct. Per explicit standing instruction, the threshold was **not** changed to make this report's numbers pass. Added `tests/test_all_required_denies_a_real_user_reported_incident_with_a_one_bit_margin` (`tests/test_authentication_debug_sprint.py`), pinning this exact incident's scores and the one-bit-margin finding as a permanent regression test - it documents that today's denial is correct, current, intentional behavior given the unmodified threshold, not a bug to silently "fix" later by editing the test.

**Decision still open, same as the prior pass:** a real, same-key, ROC-anchored threshold calibration for face and voice remains available (`scripts/calibrate_protected_thresholds.py`) and is now supported by stronger evidence (a real user's real, marginal failure), but applying it is a disclosed security/reliability tradeoff that requires the same explicit sign-off as before - not something this diagnosis pass decided unilaterally.

## Root Cause (prior pass — the voice preprocessing bug that was fixed)

A genuine enrolled speaker's second voice capture produced Hamming similarity scores scattered across ~0.62–0.84, denied under the (unmodified) 0.9 threshold. Two earlier passes at this system independently found and fixed one real preprocessing bug (`_trim_silence`'s frame-overlap duplication — see git history) and then reached for threshold calibration to close the remaining gap. This pass instead followed the investigation order requested — preprocessing determinism, embedding stability, HKDF inputs, BioHash determinism, matcher/template lookup — and found **a second, more consequential real bug in the same preprocessing module**, which fully explains the reported symptom without touching any threshold.

### The bug: waveform-domain silence padding contaminates mel-normalization

`preprocessing/voice.py::VoicePreprocessor.preprocess` computes an 80-bin log-mel filterbank and mean-normalizes it *per clip* (`log_mel - log_mel.mean(axis=1, keepdims=True)`). Before this fix, a clip whose real (VAD-trimmed) content fell **short** of the 4-second target got padded with raw silence *before* mel extraction. Padding with zeros produces STFT frames with near-zero magnitude; `log(max(magnitude, 1e-10))` for those frames is an extreme outlier (≈ −23) next to real speech frames' typical range. Because the per-clip mean is computed across *all* frames, a large-enough fraction of these outlier frames drags the mean down and shifts the normalized values for the **real speech frames too** — corrupting the very features that are supposed to represent the speaker, in a way that depends on exactly how much padding was needed (i.e., exactly how long the real recording happened to be).

A real second recording will almost never last exactly as long as the enrollment recording — a person naturally speaks a phrase a little faster or slower each time. Whichever side of the 4-second target a given take's *trimmed* length lands on determines whether it hits the stable code path (center-crop, for longer-than-target clips) or the broken one (waveform padding, for shorter-than-target clips) — this data-dependent coin flip, not a general model-accuracy problem, is what produced the reported "scattered 0.62–0.84" symptom.

### Fix

`preprocess()` now branches on whether the trimmed/normalized waveform is at least as long as the target:

- **≥ target length (unchanged):** center-crop the waveform, then extract mel + normalize — this path was already stable and is untouched.
- **< target length (fixed):** extract the mel filterbank and normalize it on the **real, unpadded** waveform first, then pad the resulting *mel frames* — not the waveform — with zeros (a neutral, already-mean-subtracted value) to reach the same frame count a full-length clip would produce. The real speech frames' statistics are never touched by the padding.

`VoicePreprocessor.__init__` precomputes `target_num_frames` (the exact frame count `scipy.signal.stft` produces for a `target_num_samples`-length signal: `1 + (target_num_samples - n_fft) // hop_length`) so this padding is exact, not approximate.

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `preprocessing/voice.py` | `preprocess()`: pad in the mel/frame domain (post-normalization) instead of the waveform domain (pre-normalization) whenever the trimmed clip is shorter than the target length. Added `target_num_frames`. `_fixed_length_segment` itself is unchanged (still used, and still correctly tested, for the ≥-target-length crop case). |
| `tests/test_voice_preprocessing.py` | Added a direct unit test proving the real frames' mel values (and their normalization) are now identical whether or not padding follows, and that padded frames are exactly zero. |
| `tests/test_voice_backend_integration.py` | Replaced the previous (threshold-calibration-dependent) genuine-success test with one that reproduces the actual bug: a second take at a different, realistic duration, asserting `authenticated: true` against the **original, unmodified 0.9 threshold**. |
| `tests/test_authentication_debug_sprint.py` | Added a voice-specific same-key impostor test at voice's real median impostor similarity, confirming the fix doesn't touch matching/security behavior. |
| `evaluation/results/voice_threshold.json`, `voice_protected_metrics.csv` | **Removed.** The previously-applied real-ROC-anchored calibration (threshold 0.58) is no longer needed and was reverted per this sprint's explicit "do not lower thresholds" instruction — see "What Changed From the Prior Pass" below. |

## Debug Report: Investigation Steps 1–5

### Step 1 — Preprocessing identical between enroll and authenticate

`backend/services/base_service.py::ModalityService.enroll` and `.authenticate` both call `self.pipeline.embed(raw_image)` with no divergence in arguments; `VoicePipeline.embed` always calls `VoicePreprocessor.preprocess(waveform, sample_rate=sample_rate, training=False)` — identical code path, identical `training=False` (deterministic center-crop / no random augmentation) in both directions. Confirmed directly:

```
[config] sample_rate=16000  clip_seconds=4.0  target_num_samples=64000  n_mels=80
[enroll]                  after_resample=64000  after_VAD_trim=63920  mel_frames=398
[authenticate, same bytes] after_resample=64000  after_VAD_trim=63920  mel_frames=398
cosine(enroll, authenticate) = 1.000000   <- exact determinism, byte-identical input
```

### Step 2 — Embedding stability for repeated recordings of the same speaker

This is where the bug was found. Comparing raw-embedding cosine similarity across realistic variations of the *same* synthetic "speaker" (before vs. after the fix):

| Scenario | cosine similarity (before fix) | cosine similarity (after fix) |
|---|---|---|
| Identical bytes replayed | 1.000000 | 1.000000 |
| Same duration, +1% sample noise | 0.850567 | 0.850567 *(unaffected — never hit the padding branch)* |
| **Second take, 3.6s vs enrolled 4.0s** | **0.255804** | **0.990855** |
| Second take, same duration + 0.4s leading silence (net *longer*, so already used the stable crop path) | 0.995831 | 0.995831 *(unaffected)* |
| Realistic combination: 3.7s speech + 0.3s lead-in + 0.2s trail-off + 2% noise | 0.257256 | 0.824944 |

Embedding dimension (192) and L2 norm (1.000000, by construction of `BaseEmbedder.extract_embedding`'s normalization) were identical in every case — the divergence was entirely in the *values*, not the shape, confirming this is a feature-corruption bug, not a wiring bug.

### Step 3 — HKDF inputs identical for enroll and authenticate

`ModalityService.authenticate` derives the key via `derive_key(settings.master_secret, application_id=application_id, user_id=user_id, modality=self.modality, key_version=stored.key_version)` — the same four fields `enroll` used, with `key_version` read from the *stored* template rather than re-derived, so a value can never drift between the two calls. `derive_key`'s HKDF salt is `SHA256(f"{application_id}|{user_id}|{modality}|{key_version}")` — fully deterministic given identical inputs (verified: identical bytes in, identical `KeyMaterial` out, in the existing `template_protection` test suite).

### Step 4 — BioHash determinism

`generate_template(embedding, key, output_bits)` is a pure function of its two arguments (`template_protection/biohash.py`): L2-normalize → project (seeded by `key.projection_seed`) → quantize (seeded by `key.threshold_seed`) → permute (seeded by `key.permutation_seed`). All three seeds come from `numpy.random.default_rng` (PCG64, a fixed, portable, non-entropy-consuming algorithm). Confirmed: identical `(embedding, key)` in → bit-for-bit identical protected template out, every time.

### Step 5 — Matcher uses the correct stored active template

`crud.get_active_template(db, user_id, modality, application_id)` filters on all three fields plus `is_active.is_(True)`; `save_template` deactivates any prior active row before inserting a new one. Live-traced in the prior sprint (unchanged this pass): correct `user_id` scoping, latest `key_version` returned after rotation, full history preserved but inactive rows excluded from lookup, a different `user_id` returns `None`.

## Final Genuine Authentication Report

Produced by `PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/debug_authentication_pipeline.py` against the current repository state — **the original, unmodified `Settings.match_threshold=0.9` fallback, no calibration file for any modality**:

```
User ID: genuine-user-001
Face Score / Threshold / Pass:        0.9844 / 0.9000 / True
Fingerprint Score / Threshold / Pass: 0.9844 / 0.9000 / True
Voice Score / Threshold / Pass:       0.9766 / 0.9000 / True
Fusion Score: 0.9818
Fusion Policy: ALL_REQUIRED
Authenticated: True   <-- ACCESS GRANTED, produced by the real backend, no bypass, no mocked score, no lowered threshold
```

The "genuine" voice sample here is the enrolled synthetic speaker's pattern re-synthesized at 3.7 seconds instead of the enrolled 4.0 seconds — exactly the realistic take-to-take duration variation that exposed the bug, not a best-case scenario.

Also confirmed via a full, real HTTP round-trip (`POST /enroll` → `POST /verify/voice`, `test_genuine_recapture_at_a_different_realistic_duration_authenticates`): a genuine second capture at a different realistic duration returns `authenticated: true` and `threshold: 0.9` through the actual API.

Across a range of realistic second-take durations (not cherry-picked):

| Second-take duration | Hamming similarity | Pass @ 0.9 |
|---|---|---|
| 3.5s | 0.9766 | True |
| 3.6s | 0.9766 | True |
| 3.7s | 0.9766 | True |
| 3.8s | 0.9688 | True |
| 3.9s | 0.9844 | True |
| 4.2s | 0.9922 | True |
| 4.5s | 0.9922 | True |

## Final Impostor Authentication Report

Two independent modalities checked at the real, measured median impostor similarity for each (not a best-case near-zero assumption), under one shared per-victim key — the actual threat model `authenticate()` implements (the candidate is always compared under the *claimed* identity's key):

```
Fingerprint: attacker at cosine 0.90 (fingerprint's real measured median impostor similarity)
             -> Hamming 0.84  -> authenticated = False  (threshold 0.9, unmodified)

Voice:       attacker at cosine 0.00 (voice's real measured median impostor similarity)
             -> Hamming 0.52  -> authenticated = False  (threshold 0.9, unmodified)
```

Both permanent regression tests (`test_a_same_key_impostor_with_realistic_similarity_is_rejected_at_the_current_threshold`, `test_a_same_key_voice_impostor_with_realistic_similarity_is_rejected`). The preprocessing fix changes only how a genuine embedding is *computed* from real audio; it does not touch `template_protection`'s matching logic, so impostor rejection is unaffected by construction — confirmed, not assumed.

## What Changed From the Prior Pass

The immediately preceding pass at this problem applied a real, same-key, ROC-anchored voice threshold (0.58) to close this same gap, after the user explicitly approved that specific tradeoff. This pass found the actual root cause instead, which removes the need for that tradeoff entirely: **the calibration was reverted** (`evaluation/results/voice_threshold.json` and `voice_protected_metrics.csv` deleted), and `Settings.match_threshold=0.9` — the original, unmodified, uncalibrated fallback — is what every number in this report is measured against. `scripts/calibrate_protected_thresholds.py` remains in the repo as a reviewed, documented tool (its methodology-fix — same-key pairing, matching this system's real threat model — is a genuine contribution independent of whether it's ever invoked again), but is not currently applied to any modality.

## Confirmation

- 295 tests passing (up from 292 in the prior pass), including three new tests that would fail if this regressed: the mel-padding-contamination unit test, the realistic-duration genuine-success integration test, and the voice same-key impostor test.
- `ALL_REQUIRED` remains the default and only fusion policy in effect. No per-modality threshold was changed, lowered, or invented. No score was mocked. No matcher was bypassed. `authenticated` was never forced to `true` — every "True" above is the real `ModalityService`/`evaluate_fusion_policy` return value, traced end-to-end.
