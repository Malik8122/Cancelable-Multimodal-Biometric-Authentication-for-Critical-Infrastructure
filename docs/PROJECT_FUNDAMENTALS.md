# Project Fundamentals — From Training to Authentication

A single, end-to-end explanation of the system as it stands today: how the models were trained on Kaggle, which datasets each modality
used, what fine-tuning was done, how a biometric becomes a protected template, how similarity and fusion work, how the backend is
organised, and how a face is registered. Every number below is taken from the repository (config files, `evaluation/results/*.csv`,
`*_threshold.json`, training notebooks) unless it is explicitly marked as *not measured* or *not established*.

Companion documents with more depth on single topics: `DATASETS.md`, `VOICE_MODEL.md`, `COMPUTER_VISION.md`, `TEMPLATE_PROTECTION.md`,
`MULTI_TEMPLATE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `BACKEND_API.md`, `AUTHENTICATION_RELIABILITY_REPORT.md`.

## 1. What the system is

A privacy-preserving multimodal authentication system for critical-infrastructure access. A person is recognised by **face**,
**fingerprint** and **voice** (iris code exists but has no trained model — see §3.4). The central design rule:

> The raw image / audio and the raw embedding are never the stored credential. What is stored — and compared — is a
> **cancelable protected template**: a 256-bit string derived from the embedding under a secret key. If it leaks, the key version is
> rotated and the user gets a completely different template from the same face, without re-capturing anything.

End-to-end pipeline:

```text
capture (image / audio)
  -> modality preprocessing (classical CV / signal processing)      preprocessing/
  -> embedding network (deep learning, fine-tuned on Kaggle)         models/
  -> BioHash cancelable transform, keyed by HKDF-SHA256              template_protection/
  -> 256-bit protected template (stored)  /  candidate template (compared)
  -> Hamming similarity per modality vs. that modality's threshold   backend/services/
  -> fusion of the submitted modalities                              fusion/
  -> ACCESS_GRANTED / ACCESS_DENIED / ENROLLMENT_REQUIRED            backend/api/fusion.py
```

Repository map: `preprocessing/` (per-modality CV), `models/` (network definitions, training code, saved checkpoints),
`embeddings/` (pipelines tying preprocessing to models, face centroid), `template_protection/` (HKDF, BioHash, matcher),
`fusion/` (score fusion, policies), `backend/` (FastAPI service, SQLite/SQLAlchemy), `frontend/` (React + Vite), `evaluation/`
(metrics, experiments, calibration), `kaggle_kernels/` and `notebooks/` (training), `tests/` (452 tests), `config/buildings.json`.

## 2. How the Kaggle training is done

### 2.1 Why Kaggle, and how a run works

Training is scripted, not manual. Each modality has a Kaggle Kernel under `kaggle_kernels/<modality>_training/` consisting of a
`kernel-metadata.json` (title, attached dataset, GPU flag, internet flag) and a notebook. `scripts/run_kaggle_kernels.py`
automates the whole cycle with the Kaggle CLI:

1. **push** — `kaggle kernels push -p kaggle_kernels/<modality>_training` starts the run on Kaggle's free GPU infrastructure;
2. **poll** — `kaggle kernels status <user>/<slug>` until `complete`;
3. **pull** — `kaggle kernels output ...` downloads the run output;
4. **install** — the resulting `.pt` and `.h5` checkpoints are copied into `models/<modality>/saved/`.

Inside each notebook: clone the repo (the specific branch — see §2.4), attach or download the dataset, preprocess with the repo's own
`preprocessing/` code, fine-tune, **save the checkpoint** (`models/common/checkpoint_io.py` writes the canonical PyTorch `.pt` plus
an `.h5` interoperability export), evaluate (accuracy / FAR / FRR / EER / ROC-AUC via `evaluation/`), and run a visual test of
genuine vs impostor pairs. `notebooks/01–04_*.ipynb` are the interactive Colab equivalents of the same logic.

### 2.2 Shared training ingredients

* **Loss — ArcFace** (`models/common/arcface.py::ArcMarginProduct`, additive angular margin softmax; Deng et al., CVPR 2019). Every
  modality reuses this one implementation, so the recipes are comparable. ArcFace trains the embedding so that same-identity vectors
  cluster tightly by *angle*, which is exactly what cosine similarity later measures.
* **Embeddings are L2-normalised**, so cosine similarity = dot product.
* **Pretrained starting point, partial unfreezing.** Only the top layers are updated; earlier layers keep pretrained features. This
  is why a few thousand images are enough and why over-fitting is controlled by *how much* is unfrozen.
* **Device guard.** `detect_device()` runs a real tensor op on CUDA at start-up and falls back to CPU if the assigned GPU is
  unsupported (Kaggle sometimes assigns a Tesla P100, compute capability 6.0, which the preinstalled PyTorch build has no kernels for).
  The face, voice and first fingerprint runs actually trained on CPU because of this.

### 2.3 Per-modality training summary

| | Face | Fingerprint | Voice | Iris |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backbone | InceptionResnetV1 (`facenet-pytorch`), **pretrained on VGGFace2** | ResNet50, **pretrained on ImageNet** (`IMAGENET1K_V2`) | ECAPA-TDNN (SpeechBrain module), trained with the repo's own pipeline | ResNet18 (ImageNet) + projection head |
| Embedding size | 512 | 512 | 192 | 256 |
| Dataset | LFW | SOCOFing "Real" | VoxCeleb1 subset (Indian celebrities) | CASIA-Iris-Thousand mirror |
| Loss | ArcFace + CrossEntropy | ArcFace + label smoothing 0.1 + hard-negative hinge | ArcFace (m 0.5, s 30) | ArcFace |
| Trained checkpoint in repo | yes | yes | yes | **no** |

### 2.4 Problems hit while running real training (and the fixes)

Wrong branch cloned (fixed: clone the specific branch); `pip install facenet-pytorch` silently replaced Kaggle's GPU-matched
`torch` and downgraded `numpy` (fixed: `--no-deps`, only in the face notebook); unsupported P100 (fixed: CUDA smoke-test + CPU
fallback); iris data-loader missing imports; iris evaluation shape bug (`(H,W)` strip vs the 3-channel contract). Details: `PROJECT_REPORT.md` §8.3.

---

## 3. Datasets and fine-tuning, per modality

No dataset is committed to the repo; raw biometrics exist only inside the training runtime (`DATASETS.md`, `PRIVACY_AND_SECURITY.md`).

### 3.1 Face — LFW, fine-tuned FaceNet

* **Dataset:** LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild), fetched in-kernel with `sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people(min_faces_per_person=20,
  funneled=True, color=True)` → **3,023 images, 62 identities**. Non-commercial research license.
* **Model:** `InceptionResnetV1(pretrained='vggface2')` — already trained for face verification on VGGFace2 (~8.6k identities).
* **Preprocessing before training:** MTCNN detect → **bounding-box** crop resized to 160×160 (no landmark alignment); pixels normalised `(x-127.5)/128`.
* **Fine-tuning:** everything frozen **except** `block8`, `last_linear`, `last_bn`; ArcFace head over the 62 identities; Adam,
  lr 1e-4; batch 32; **10 epochs**.
* **Result (from the run):** epoch 10 — train acc 0.976, val acc 0.913; **EER 0.010, AUC 0.999** (`evaluation/results/face_metrics.csv`).
* **Read this honestly:** the 62 identities are both the fine-tuning classes and the evaluation identities, so this is not an
  open-set benchmark on unseen people. The strong numbers mostly reflect the VGGFace2 pretraining; the fine-tune adapts the top layers.
  It is also **not** evidence about real-webcam, real-world captures (see §7).

### 3.2 Fingerprint — SOCOFing, ResNet50 (substituting DeepPrint)

* **Dataset:** SOCOFing (Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint Dataset), Kaggle `ruizgara/socofing`; the unaltered **"Real"** folder only —
  6,000 images, 600 subjects (identity, hand and finger encoded in the file name, e.g. `1__M_Left_index_finger.BMP`).
* **Why not DeepPrint:** DeepPrint has no released weights or reference implementation; ResNet50 + the shared ArcFace head is a
  reproducible substitute (`PROJECT_REPORT.md` §7.1).
* **Preprocessing (classical CV, `preprocessing/fingerprint.py`):** grayscale → CLAHE (clip 3, 8×8) → ridge normalisation (target
  mean 100 / var 100) → 3×3 Gaussian blur → **Gabor filter bank** (8 orientations, max response) → min-max normalise → resize 224 →
  3-channel → ImageNet mean/std.
* **Model:** ResNet50 with named layers + projection head `2048→1024→BatchNorm→ReLU→Dropout(0.3)→512`, L2-normalised.
* **First attempt (superseded):** last block only, per-image split inside each subject → val acc 0.000, AUC 0.579. Two flaws were
  found: the split leaked identities across train/val/test, and capacity/regularisation were poorly matched to 600 classes.
* **Upgraded recipe (`models/fingerprint/`, `FingerprintConfig`):**
  * **subject-disjoint split** 70/15/15 (each subject in exactly one split, seed 42) — validation/test people are never seen in
    training, so evaluation is genuine/impostor **pair** verification, not classification;
  * freeze `conv1`, `bn1`, `layer1`; fine-tune `layer2–4` + head;
  * ArcFace margin 0.5, scale 64, **label smoothing 0.1**;
  * **balanced P×K batches** (16 identities × 4 samples = 64) so every batch has positives and negatives;
  * **hard-negative mining:** from epoch 10, hinge penalty (margin 0.3, weight 0.1) on the most similar impostor pairs;
  * AdamW (lr 3e-4, wd 1e-4), grad-clip 1.0, mixed precision, **3-epoch warm-up + cosine** to 1e-6, up to 30 epochs;
  * **early stopping on validation EER** (patience 8, not before epoch 10 — an earlier setting stopped a real run at epoch 6);
  * training-only augmentation (affine ±12° / ±5 % / 0.9–1.1×, brightness/contrast, noise, motion blur, light elastic/grid
    distortion, random crop) — **no flips**, since a mirrored ridge pattern is not a valid fingerprint.
* **Result on held-out subjects** (`fingerprint_metrics.csv`): 900 test samples, 4,050 genuine / 400,500 impostor pairs;
  **EER 30.8 %, AUC 0.764**. Better than the first attempt, still weak. **Fingerprint is the weakest modality**; ~10 impressions per
  subject and 600 classes are hard for this recipe.

### 3.3 Voice — VoxCeleb1 subset, ECAPA-TDNN

* **Dataset:** Kaggle `gaurav41/voxceleb1-audio-wav-files-for-india-celebrity` (DbCL-1.0), a **subset** of VoxCeleb1: **24 speakers,
  4,857 utterances**, split per speaker 70/15/15 → 3,389 / 717 / 751. The full ~1,251-speaker corpus is too large to fetch
  unattended in one kernel session.
* **Preprocessing (`preprocessing/voice.py`, numpy + scipy only):** mono → resample 16 kHz → energy-threshold VAD → RMS loudness
  normalisation → 4 s segment (random crop when training, centre crop at inference) → **80-bin log-mel** (n_fft 400, hop 160,
  mean-normalised).
* **Model:** ECAPA-TDNN (Desplanques et al. 2020: TDNN + squeeze-excitation channel attention + multi-layer aggregation) →
  **192-d** L2-normalised speaker embedding. Because the repo's `BaseEmbedder` contract expects a 3-channel array, the 2-D
  spectrogram is stacked to pseudo-RGB and channel 0 is taken back out inside the model (lossless).
* **Training:** ArcFace (m 0.5, s 30), AdamW lr 1e-3 / wd 1e-4, cosine schedule, batch 64, mixed precision, **30 epochs, ~8 hours on
  CPU** (the assigned P100 was unsupported). Augmentation is configurable but was **disabled** in the committed run
  (`training_config.json`: `augmentation_enabled: false`).
* **Result:** on 751 held-out utterances — **EER 2.29 %, AUC 0.9967**; mean genuine cosine ≈ 0.895, impostor ≈ 0.132
  (`voice_metrics.csv`). Split is per-utterance within speaker, not the official VoxCeleb trial protocol, so the speakers overlap
  with training; treat it as a strong same-domain result, not as a claim about arbitrary microphones.

### 3.4 Iris — implemented, not trained

CASIA-Iris-Thousand (via an unofficial Kaggle mirror with unverified redistribution rights), ResNet18 + projection head. One run
trained fully but a clean evaluated checkpoint was blocked by Kaggle's free GPU quota. `models/iris/saved/` is empty, so the iris
service runs a deterministic mock embedding. **Iris is not offered in the web app** (the product uses face / fingerprint / voice).

---

## 4. Embeddings, similarity, and thresholds

There are **two different similarity scores** in the system; confusing them is the main source of misreading results.

### 4.1 Embedding cosine similarity (model-quality metric)

`cos(a, b) = a·b` for unit vectors, range −1…1. Used **offline** in `evaluation/` to compute genuine/impostor score
distributions, FAR/FRR, EER and ROC-AUC (`evaluation/metrics.py`), and in voice enrollment quality grading (§6.3). It is never used
in the live match decision, because the raw embedding is not stored.

### 4.2 Hamming similarity of protected templates (the live match score)

`template_protection/matcher.py::compare`: `similarity = (number of equal bits) / (total bits)`, range 0…1; 1.0 = identical,
≈0.5 = unrelated. Both templates are 256 bits (`Settings.template_bits`). This is the score every threshold applies to.

Why it is not the same scale as cosine: the BioHash step keeps only the *sign* of 256 random projections, so template similarity is a
compressed, non-linear function of embedding cosine. Measured mapping in this project:

| Embedding cosine | Template (Hamming) similarity |
|---|---|
| ≈ 0.95 | ≈ 0.90 |
| ≈ 0.75 | ≈ 0.80 |
| ≈ 0.50 | ≈ 0.72 |
| ≈ 0.30 | ≈ 0.64 |
| ≈ 0 (unrelated) | ≈ 0.50 |

So a threshold of 0.90 means "embeddings nearly identical (cosine ~0.95)", far stricter than the 0.90 sounds.

### 4.3 Thresholds in force

Per-modality thresholds are read from `evaluation/results/<modality>_threshold.json` by `backend/threshold_loader.py` (cached per
process — **restart the backend after editing**); if a file is absent the fallback is `Settings.match_threshold = 0.90`.

| Modality | Threshold | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Face | **0.80** | operator-specified |
| Voice | **0.80** | operator-specified |
| Fingerprint | 0.90 | fallback (no file) |
| Iris | 0.90 | fallback (no file) |

The 0.80 values are operator choices, **not** the output of a genuine/impostor calibration run, so no FAR/FRR/EER is claimed for
them. Face was briefly set to 0.72 and **reset to 0.80**: lowering it would also make AI-generated faces more likely to pass (§7).

---

## 5. Template protection (cancelable biometrics)

`template_protection/`, documented in `TEMPLATE_PROTECTION.md`.

1. **Key derivation — HKDF-SHA256** (`hkdf_keys.py`). Inputs: server-side `MASTER_SECRET` and the context
   `application_id | user_id | modality | key_version`. The context is hashed to a fixed-length salt; three separate HKDF calls (different `info`
   strings) yield three independent 32-byte seeds: **projection**, **permutation**, **threshold**. Nothing is stored; keys are re-derived on demand.
2. **BioHash generation** (`biohash.py`, `transform.py`):
   1. L2-normalise the embedding;
   2. **project** with a key-seeded random orthonormal matrix (QR of a Gaussian matrix) → 256 values in [−1, 1];
   3. **quantise** each value to a bit against a key-seeded random threshold centred on 0 (jitter ∝ 0.5·std of the projection);
   4. **permute** the bits with a key-seeded permutation.
   Output: 256 bits, stored packed in `protected_templates`.
3. **Match:** derive the same key, run the *live* embedding through the same transform, compare bits with Hamming similarity.
4. **Revocation / diversity:** change `key_version` (or the application id) and every seed changes → a statistically unrelated
   template from the same biometric (mean pairwise Hamming similarity 0.500 between sets, `template_set_diversity.csv`).

Stated limits (not overclaimed): many-to-one and lossy, but **not** a proven one-way function; if `MASTER_SECRET` and the template both leak,
partial reconstruction is a known attack class. There is no formal security proof.

### 5.1 Template sets (T1–T4)

One credential = **one template per enrolled modality**, and a *set* is that credential at one key version. Each user gets a pool of
**four sets** (`TEMPLATE_POOL_SIZE = 4`): T1 `ACTIVE`, T2–T4 `STANDBY`; revoked sets become `REVOKED` and key versions are never reused.
Authentication uses only the `ACTIVE` set and a runtime check forbids mixing sets. Revoking makes the oldest standby set active for
every modality at once **without re-capturing anything**; an empty pool returns 409 (re-enroll). Because there is no login,
revoke / activate / generate first require a biometric match against the ACTIVE set (HTTP 403 otherwise).

---

## 6. Enrollment

`POST /enroll` (multipart). The backend embeds the capture once, generates the four template sets from that single embedding, stores
only protected templates, and discards the embedding and the raw sample.

### 6.1 How a face is registered (one-time, five poses, centroid)

Implemented in `backend/services/face_enrollment.py`, `embeddings/centroid.py`, `preprocessing/face.py`; UI in
`frontend/src/components/capture/GuidedFaceCapture.tsx`.

1. **Guided capture.** The UI walks the user through five steps with a circular face guide: **Front, Left, Right, Slight Up,
   Slight Down** (sent as `pose_front … pose_down`). Each capture is checked immediately via `POST /enroll/face/check-pose`
   (stores nothing); a bad capture is retaken on the spot.
2. **Per pose, the backend runs:** MTCNN face detection → bounding-box crop resized to 160×160 (default mode; see FACE_ALIGNMENT) → one 512-d FaceNet
   embedding (the fine-tuned checkpoint).
3. **Rejection rules** (`embeddings/pipelines.py::_evaluate_face_quality`): `NO_FACE`, `MULTIPLE_FACES`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE` (< 0.90),
   `BLURRY` (Laplacian variance of the crop < 25; measured: normal webcam-quality crops 116–920, visibly blurred ≤ 34),
   `TOO_SMALL` (size ratio < 0.15), `OFF_CENTER` (> 0.35), `TOO_ANGLED` (roll > 20° or yaw ratio > 0.20); in the aligned mode also
   `LANDMARK_FAILURE` / `ALIGNMENT_FAILED`. At least 3 of 5 poses must be VALID.
4. **Centroid.** The valid unit embeddings are averaged and the mean is re-normalised: `centroid = normalize(mean(e_1 … e_k))`,
   with **at least 3 valid poses** required (fewer → 422, nothing stored).
5. **Templates from the centroid only.** T1–T4 are produced by the unchanged HKDF + BioHash path from the centroid; the temporary
   per-pose embeddings are discarded immediately. A single `image` still enrolls a face from one capture.
6. **Authentication stays single-shot:** one live image → one embedding → compared with the ACTIVE template. No head-turn prompts.

What is established and what is not: the design intent is that a centroid sits in the middle of the person's pose cloud. On the only
offline data available (one portrait with rotations/shifts/exposure changes) centroid and single-image templates behaved alike
(mean template similarity 0.926 vs 0.929). Real head-turn captures across real people have **not** been evaluated.

### 6.2 Fingerprint
A PNG/JPG/JPEG upload → preprocessing (§3.2) → embedding → templates.

### 6.3 Voice (two recordings, graded consistency)
The user records the phrase twice in one request (`image` + `confirm_image`). The two ECAPA embeddings are compared by cosine:

| Cosine | Grade | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 0.85 | Excellent | enrolled |
| 0.75 – 0.84 | Good | enrolled |
| 0.60 – 0.74 | Fair | `409 LOW_QUALITY_WARNING` unless `accept_low_quality=true` |
| < 0.60 | Poor | `422 ENROLLMENT_INCONSISTENT`, nothing stored |

### 6.4 Enrollment status
Derived from ACTIVE-set rows plus an `enrollment_events` table: `NOT_REGISTERED`, `REGISTERED`, `UPDATED`, `RETRY_REQUIRED` (voice only).

---

## 7. Authentication and fusion

### 7.1 Flow (`POST /authenticate/fusion`, `backend/services/authentication.py`)

1. **The user chooses the modalities** to present ("Select biometric factors for this authentication session"). Buildings
   (`config/buildings.json`) carry only id, name, clearance level and description — the loader rejects any `required_modalities`.
2. If a submitted modality is **not enrolled** → `409 ENROLLMENT_REQUIRED`: nothing is evaluated, and it is audited as its own state, not as a failure.
3. Otherwise, **exactly the submitted modalities** are evaluated: preprocess → embed → BioHash with the ACTIVE set's key →
   Hamming similarity vs the stored template → compared with that modality's threshold.
4. Fuse and decide → `ACCESS_GRANTED` or `ACCESS_DENIED`.

### 7.2 Fusion definition

* `fusion_similarity` = **weighted average of the per-modality Hamming similarities, equal weights**, renormalised over the modalities
  actually submitted (`fusion/score_fusion.py`); an absent modality is never treated as zero.
* `fusion_distance = 1 − fusion_similarity`.
* `fusion_threshold` = mean of the per-modality thresholds used (e.g. face 0.80 + voice 0.80 → 0.80).
* **Decision policy** (`fusion/config.py`, `fusion/policy.py`):
  * **`ALL_REQUIRED` (default):** every submitted modality must individually pass its own threshold. This fixed an audit finding in
    which a strong modality could average away another modality's failure.
  * `AT_LEAST_TWO`: with exactly three modalities, two must pass.
  * `WEIGHTED`: the fused average must reach the fusion threshold, but any modality below a 0.5 floor vetoes.

So under the default policy the fused score is informational and the gate is "all presented factors pass individually".
The client receives only `fusion_similarity`, `fusion_distance`, `fusion_threshold`, `authentication_state`, `matched_modalities`,
`active_template_set` and `key_version`. Per-modality scores appear in responses only when `DEBUG_SCORES=true`, and always in the audit table.
The denied screen shows no similarity.

---

## 8. Backend

FastAPI + SQLAlchemy on SQLite (`DATABASE_PATH`/`DATABASE_URL`), started with `python -m uvicorn backend.main:app`. `MASTER_SECRET` is required.

**Layers**

* `backend/api/` — thin HTTP routers; `backend/services/` — logic; `backend/database/` — models, CRUD, migration (`scripts/migrate_to_multi_template.py`), audit;
  `backend/security_validation.py`, `backend/threshold_loader.py`, `backend/buildings.py`, `backend/states.py`.
* `backend/services/base_service.py::ModalityService` — one class parametrised by modality (face / iris / fingerprint / voice):
  `enroll` (embed → derive key → BioHash → store per set) and `authenticate` (embed → BioHash with ACTIVE key → Hamming → threshold).
  Models load lazily and cached (memory was tuned after a Render out-of-memory investigation: `mmap` + `assign` checkpoint loading, no
  pretrained download on the serving path).
* `backend/services/{enrollment,authentication,template_sets,recording_quality,face_enrollment}.py` — the flows described above.

**Endpoints:** `POST /enroll`, `POST /enroll/face/check-pose`; `POST /authenticate/fusion`, `POST /authenticate`, `POST /verify/{face|iris|fingerprint|voice}`;
`GET /templates/{user_id}`, `POST /templates/{user_id}/activate/{version}`, `POST /templates/{user_id}/generate`, `POST /revoke-template`;
`GET /user/{user_id}`, `GET /user/{user_id}/enrollment-status`, `DELETE /user/{user_id}`; `GET /buildings`, `GET /building/{id}`;
`GET /audit/{user_id}`, `GET /audit/system`, `DELETE /audit/{user_id}`; `GET /metrics/{modality}`, `GET /system/health`.

**Data:** `users`; `protected_templates` (per user × modality × application × key version: packed 256-bit template, set status ACTIVE/STANDBY/REVOKED,
template/key versions); `audit_logs` (per-modality similarities, thresholds used, fusion values, policy, submitted / enrolled / authenticated modalities,
state, latency, template & key versions); `enrollment_events`. No raw image, audio or embedding is ever stored.

**Security validation** (`backend/security_validation.py`): runtime checks on the template pipeline, including the rule that templates of different sets are never compared with each other.

**Frontend (React/Vite):** landing, building checkpoint, Register (three independent enrollment cards: guided face, fingerprint upload,
voice with the Recording Quality panel), Authenticate (factor selection then capture), Result, Template Management (pool of sets with
biometric authorization), Template Protection explainer, Analytics.

## 9. What was found while making genuine users work

* Genuine users were denied at the 0.90 fallback because 0.90 template similarity ≈ embedding cosine 0.95, which webcam/microphone captures
  rarely reach (`AUTHENTICATION_RELIABILITY_REPORT.md`). Face/voice moved to 0.80; a real-user's logged **face** attempts (15) scored
  **0.738–0.859, mean 0.784, only 5 ≥ 0.80**; **voice** ≈ 0.79–0.91; fingerprint 1.0 (the same file resubmitted).
* **Why real face scores are ~0.78 rather than ~0.9 is not established.** A five-pose centroid pulling frontal matches down is one
  hypothesis; untested on real captures.
* A lower face threshold was rejected by the operator: FaceNet-style embeddings cannot tell an AI-generated face from a real one.

---

## 10. Limitations (current state)

* **No liveness / anti-spoofing** — printed photos, screen replays and AI-generated faces are not detected; the threshold is a weak lever for that.
* Fingerprint is weak (EER 30.8 %, AUC 0.764 on held-out subjects); iris has no trained model.
* Face and voice metrics come from small, same-domain datasets (62 LFW identities; 24 voice speakers) and are not open-set or real-device benchmarks.
* The 0.80 thresholds are operator-set, not calibrated; no FAR/FRR is claimed for them.
* The template scheme has no formal security proof; security rests on `MASTER_SECRET` and on embeddings not leaking.
* No login layer; management actions are authorised by biometric match, which is only as strong as the weakest matched modality.
* Research/capstone system, not a hardened product; SQLite storage.

Suggested next steps (not started): compare frontal-only against five-pose enrollment on real captures to see whether the centroid lowers frontal similarity;
add a liveness / presentation-attack check; calibrate per-modality thresholds from genuine/impostor data collected on real devices; retrain fingerprint on
more data/impressions; finish the iris checkpoint if iris is wanted.
