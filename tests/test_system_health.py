"""Offline tests for GET /system/health.

The whole point of this endpoint is to be safe to poll frequently (the
frontend does, every 15s - frontend/src/hooks/useAuthSession.ts) on a
memory-constrained deployment. Before the fix this pass, it called
get_face_service()/get_fingerprint_service()/get_voice_service()
unconditionally, forcing all three real checkpoints (100+ MB each) to load
into memory on the very first poll - see backend/api/system.py's docstring
and docs/AUTHENTICATION_RELIABILITY_REPORT.md's Render OOM section. These
tests pin the fix: the endpoint must report status without ever calling a
not-yet-loaded modality's service getter.
