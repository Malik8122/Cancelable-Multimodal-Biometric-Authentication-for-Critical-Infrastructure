"""Offline tests for Voice's backend integration (Phase 3A, Step 2).

Voice was added as a modality after Phase 2's backend was built, so it never
had a `backend/services/voice_service.py` or a `/verify/voice` route until
this integration - these tests exist specifically to prove that gap is
closed: the real trained checkpoint loads (not mock mode), the
`_VoicePipelineAdapter` correctly bridges `VoicePipeline`'s two-argument
`embed(waveform, sample_rate)` to `ModalityService`'s single-argument
`embed(raw_image)` contract, and the full enroll -> verify flow works
end-to-end through the actual HTTP API, mirroring `tests/test_backend_api.py`'s
fixture/pattern exactly (iris there, voice here).
