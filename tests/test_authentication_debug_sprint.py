"""Regression tests from the "genuine user is being denied" debug sprint.

Root-caused via `scripts/debug_authentication_pipeline.py` (kept in the repo
so this trace can be re-run against any future checkpoint/preprocessing
change): two distinct, real contributing causes were found.

1. **A concrete bug** in `preprocessing/voice.py::VoicePreprocessor._trim_silence`
   (fixed in this sprint - see `tests/test_voice_preprocessing.py`'s new
   tests): overlapping voiced frames were concatenated directly instead of
   merged into a per-sample mask, inflating a fully-voiced 4-second clip to
   ~2.5x its length. `_fixed_length_segment`'s center-crop then selected from
   that unstable, duplicated sequence, so a tiny amount of realistic capture
   noise produced a wildly different final segment - observed as a genuine
   same-speaker cosine similarity of -0.18 instead of ~1.0.

2. **A separate, pre-existing, NOT fixed here** gap: `Settings.match_threshold`
   (0.9) is applied as a fallback to every modality whenever
   `evaluation/results/<modality>_threshold.json` doesn't exist yet - which is
   currently the case for all of face/fingerprint/voice (confirmed: the
   directory holds only the *_metrics.csv/*_roc.csv files from the Kaggle
   *raw-embedding* evaluation runs, no *_threshold.json calibrated on
   protected-template Hamming scores). 0.9 was never validated against that
   score space; `config.py`'s own comment already flags it as "a conservative
   starting point... real deployments should tune this... rather than
   trusting this default blindly." Combined with `ALL_REQUIRED` fusion policy
   (every submitted modality must individually pass), a single modality
   sitting a little under 0.9 - which the debug script shows even a *fixed*
   voice pipeline can genuinely do (~0.84-0.88 Hamming similarity for a
   realistic small amount of capture variation) - is enough to deny an
   otherwise-genuine multi-factor authentication.

   This second gap is a **data** problem (no real, labeled, multi-sample
   dataset is available in this environment to calibrate against - see
   `evaluation/threshold_calibration.py`'s own docstring on why calibrating
   against synthetic data would produce "a mathematically valid but
   biometrically meaningless number"), not a code bug, so it is deliberately
   NOT "fixed" by lowering `match_threshold` here - that would be exactly the
   "do not lower thresholds blindly" / "do not fake success" thing this sprint
   was told not to do. `get_modality_threshold` already picks up a real
   calibration file automatically the moment one is produced - no code change
   needed for that later.

A follow-up reliability sprint investigated real-data-anchored calibration
further (see `scripts/calibrate_protected_thresholds.py`, uncommitted output)
and surfaced two more important, real findings, captured here as permanent
regression tests:

3. fingerprint's real, measured raw-embedding accuracy is genuinely weak
   (EER=30.77%, and its real *median impostor* cosine similarity is ~0.90 -
   evaluation/results/fingerprint_roc.csv) - close enough to genuine-pair
   territory that no protected-template threshold choice can make this
   specific checkpoint both "always accept genuine" and "always reject a
   realistic impostor" at once. That is a raw-model-accuracy ceiling, not
   something the template-protection layer can calibrate around.
4. A calibration methodology pitfall: pairing genuine/impostor samples under
   *different* per-identity keys (as `evaluation/threshold_calibration.py`'s
   general-purpose pairing does) measures an easier question than what this
   system's real authenticate() flow does - it always compares under the
   *claimed* identity's one key, for both the genuine candidate and any
   impostor's candidate. A threshold calibrated against different-key pairs
   looked cleanly separated but let a same-key impostor through in a direct
   `ModalityService.authenticate()` check. `test_a_same_key_impostor_...`
   below pins the *correct* (same-key) threat model as a permanent test.
