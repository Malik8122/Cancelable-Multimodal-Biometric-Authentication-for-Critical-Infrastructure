"""Offline tests for fusion/diagnostics.py::build_fusion_diagnostics.

Pure function tests, no HTTP/database - mirrors tests/test_fusion.py and tests/test_fusion_policies.py's
style. `test_all_required_denies_despite_a_fused_score_above_threshold` chains the real
`evaluate_fusion_policy` (fusion/policy.py) into `build_fusion_diagnostics` to prove the
diagnostics object reports the SAME override this project's actual fusion engine already applies
- the exact audit-finding scenario `tests/test_fusion_policies.py::test_all_required_blocks_the_compensatory_averaging_bug`
pins at the policy level, reproduced here at the diagnostics-reporting level.
