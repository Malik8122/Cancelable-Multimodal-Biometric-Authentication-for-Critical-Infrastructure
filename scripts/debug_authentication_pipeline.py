"""Authentication debug sprint: trace enroll -> authenticate -> fusion end to end.

Run with: PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/debug_authentication_pipeline.py

Produced the evidence behind the "genuine user is being denied" investigation
(see tests/test_authentication_debug_sprint.py for the resulting regression
tests). Exercises the REAL production code path -
`backend.services.ModalityService.enroll/.authenticate` and
`fusion.policy.evaluate_fusion_policy` - against the real trained checkpoints
for face/fingerprint/voice, using synthetic-but-structured inputs (no real
biometric dataset is committed to this repo - see evaluation/results/, which
holds only *_metrics.csv from the Kaggle training runs, never raw
images/audio). The "genuine" sample for each modality is the "enroll" sample
plus a small, realistic amount of noise, standing in for the natural
variation between two real captures of the same person.

Findings (see this module's inline prints, and
tests/test_authentication_debug_sprint.py's docstring for the full writeup):

1. A real bug in preprocessing/voice.py::VoicePreprocessor._trim_silence
   (fixed) made voice's embedding wildly unstable under any realistic capture
   variation - a genuine recapture's cosine similarity could come out
   *negative*. Fixed; this script's voice numbers now reflect the fix.
2. A separate, NOT-fixed-here gap: Settings.match_threshold=0.9 is an
   uncalibrated fallback applied to every modality (no
   evaluation/results/<modality>_threshold.json exists yet), and BioHash
   quantization measurably degrades similarity versus raw cosine even for
   genuine pairs - closing this properly needs real calibration data this
   environment doesn't have (see evaluation/threshold_calibration.py).
