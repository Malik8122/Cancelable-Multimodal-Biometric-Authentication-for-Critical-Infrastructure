"""Calibrate protected-template (BioHash Hamming-similarity) thresholds for
fingerprint and voice, anchored to real operating points read off each
modality's actual ROC curve (evaluation/results/<modality>_roc.csv, from
real Kaggle test-set evaluation) - not a guess, and not the EER crossover
either (see below for why).

Background (see docs/AUTHENTICATION_RELIABILITY_REPORT.md for the full
writeup): the backend was falling back to Settings.match_threshold=0.9 for
every modality because no evaluation/results/<modality>_threshold.json
existed. 0.9 was never validated against the score space authentication
actually compares (protected-template Hamming similarity), and real project
data shows it's the wrong number in both directions depending on modality:
voice's real raw-embedding EER operating point is at cosine~0.32 (nowhere
near the ~1.0 that 0.9 implicitly assumes), while fingerprint's real EER
point is at cosine~0.91 with a 30.77% error rate *there* - a genuinely weak
model, honestly already documented (see evaluation/results/fingerprint_metrics.csv).

Why the EER crossover is the wrong anchor for a security threshold: EER is
where false-accept and false-reject rates are *equal*, not where they're
*low*. For fingerprint's 30.77%-EER checkpoint, anchoring "genuine" there
would mean roughly a third of impostor attempts also clear that threshold -
weakening security, not fixing reliability. This script instead reads: (a)
the lowest threshold that still keeps FAR at or below 5% in the real ROC
curve, as the "genuine" anchor - a security-conscious operating point, not
the weakest one that happens to balance errors - and (b) the real ROC
curve's own median-impostor operating point (FAR=50%), as the "impostor"
anchor - honest about how much real overlap fingerprint's checkpoint
actually has (its real median impostor cosine is ~0.90 - nowhere near 0),
rather than assuming a best-case separation that isn't real.

**Critical pairing detail, fixed after an earlier version of this script got
it wrong**: `backend/services/base_service.py::authenticate` always derives
the comparison key from the *claimed* user_id, for both the stored template
and the freshly-generated candidate - so a real impostration attempt (person
B presenting their own biometric while claiming to be user A) compares B's
embedding against A's template *under A's key*, not under two different
keys. An earlier version of this script built genuine/impostor pairs across
several different labels, each with its *own* derived key (mirroring
evaluation/threshold_calibration.py's general-purpose pairing) - that
measures a materially easier question (does a different *key* mask a
similar embedding?) than the one that actually matters here (does the same
*key*'s BioHash projection still separate two different people's raw
embeddings?), and produced a threshold that looked cleanly separated in
calibration but let a same-key impostor through in a real
ModalityService.authenticate() check. This version builds every genuine AND
impostor pair under one shared per-"victim" key, matching the real
threat model exactly.

Why this script exists instead of running evaluation/threshold_calibration.py
directly on real embeddings: the raw per-sample embeddings from the Kaggle
evaluation runs were never persisted (only the aggregate ROC/metrics were
saved), and regenerating them means re-downloading the datasets and
re-running inference - out of scope for this reliability sprint. A prior
attempt to substitute purely synthetic (noise/geometric-pattern) "identities"
run through the real trained networks was tried and rejected (see
tests/test_authentication_debug_sprint.py's docstring): these specific
networks collapse any out-of-distribution synthetic input toward
near-identical embeddings regardless of "identity", making a
network-generated synthetic impostor distribution meaningless.

What this script does instead: construct embedding-space vectors directly
(never touching the neural networks, sidestepping that OOD-collapse problem
entirely) whose cosine similarities are set, by exact geometric
construction, to the real genuine/impostor operating points above.
`derive_key` / `generate_template` / `compare` below are the unmodified real
production code; only the *input similarity values* are synthetic, and both
are pinned to real, previously measured facts about this project's own
trained models - not chosen to produce a target answer. This is
real-anchored calibration, not a real multi-sample-per-identity dataset -
the output JSON says so explicitly, and should be replaced the moment such a
dataset is available (no code change needed for that: backend/threshold_loader.py
already reads whatever <modality>_threshold.json exists).

Face is deliberately left untouched: evaluation/results/face_metrics.csv has
no ROC curve to anchor to (only accuracy/eer/auc), and every real test in
this project's debug sprints has shown face reliably authenticating at the
existing 0.9 fallback - there is no measured problem there to fix.
