"""Per-modality threshold calibration on **protected-template** Hamming scores.

The audit finding this fixes: `backend/config.py::Settings.match_threshold`
was a single hardcoded 0.9 applied to every modality, never validated against
the score space authentication actually compares (protected-template Hamming
similarity, via `template_protection.matcher.compare`) - only raw-embedding
cosine similarity had ever been measured (`evaluation/fingerprint_metrics.py`,
`evaluation/voice_metrics.py`). `evaluation/privacy_metrics.py`'s
`experiment_protected_far_frr` already computed a single EER point in the
right score space, but only from inside the test suite, never as a saved
report - this module generalizes that into a full threshold sweep and the
loader the backend now actually reads (see `backend/threshold_loader.py`).

Two outputs per modality, both derived from the same sweep so they can never
disagree with each other:

- `evaluation/results/<modality>_threshold.json` - the single EER-optimal
  operating point, in the exact shape `backend/threshold_loader.py` loads.
- `evaluation/results/<modality>_protected_metrics.csv` - the full sweep
  (threshold, accuracy, far, frr, eer, tp, fp, tn, fn), one row per
  threshold from 0.50 to 1.00.
